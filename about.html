<p>I specialize in creating sites for individuals and small businesses. You shouldn’t have to settle for cheap solutions or generic templates. I provide custom designs at afforable prices. Frequently your website is the first impression your customers will get, so make sure it’s a good one. Since my time is split between a few different things, I’m not able to take on every project I’d like to, but I'm always looking for fun work. Take a look at my portfolio below, if you think I’d be a good match send me an email.</p>
